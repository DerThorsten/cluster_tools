# Cluster Tools

Workflows for 3D Neuron-EM-segmentation on the Janelia Cluster.

## Workflows

- Connected Components
- Watersheds
- Masked Watersheds
- Region Graph
- Edge Features from Boundary or Affinity Maps
- BLock-wise Agglomeration (Multicut or Agglomeative Clustering)

TODO: Masked Watersheds:
- Move call to  `prepare.py` before call to `make_batch_jobs.py`.
- Check blocking for blocks different from chunks.

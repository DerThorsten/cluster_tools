# Cluster Tools

Workflows for 3D Neuron-EM-segmentation on the Janelia Cluster.

## Workflows

- Connected Components
- Watersheds
- Masked Watersheds
- Region Graph

TODO: Masked Watersheds:
- Move call to  `prepare.py` before call to `make_batch_jobs.py`.
- Check blocking for blocks different from chunks.

TODO: Region Graphs:
- ATM don't support node adjacency lookup, do we need this ?
